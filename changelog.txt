Date: 2024.02.27
  Features:
    - Added new startup setting to show/hide more details on beacon tooltips

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.5
Date: 2024.02.25
  Features:
    - Added a startup setting to enable/disable stat changes to beacons from other mods
  Changes:
    - More balancing for various smaller mods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4
Date: 2024.02.25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some bugs that could occur when disabling beacons via the settings
    - Fixed a potential incompatibility between Space Exploration and 5Dim's (and perhaps other beacon mods)
  Changes:
    - Added initial support for Ultracube - still need to disable beacon overloading
    - Added initial support for Power Crystals - they still get a warning icon stuck on them even though they aren't affected
    - Adjusted balance for some smaller beacon-specific mods to be less cheaty
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3
Date: 2024.02.23
  Changes:
    - Added support for Pyanodons - AM:FM beacons have strict exclusion areas but don't disable each other
    - Added support for 248k - linked beacons have strict exclusion areas but don't disable each other
    - Added support for Bob's - tiered beacons don't disable standard beacons and vice versa
    - Added support for 5Dim's - tiered beacons don't disable standard beacons and vice versa
    - Added support for FactorioExtended Vanilla Plus - tiered beacons don't disable standard beacons and vice versa
    - Improved generic support for ingredient matching and recipe ordering
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2
Date: 2024.02.21
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected typo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 2024.02.21
  Features:
    - Recipes will now match ingredients with the standard beacon or other introductory beacons if changed by other mods
    - Added a startup setting to override changes to the standard beacon from other mods (enabled by default)
  Balancing:
    - Increased recipe costs for node, conflux, hub, and isolation beacons
  Changes:
    - New beacons from mods with "beacon overload" are given an exclusion range which mimics the overload effect, allowing them to
      function alongside the beacons from this mod with minimal differences if the overloading mechanic is disabled
    - Added initial support for Space Exploration - for now, disabling the overloading mechanic still requires manually commenting
      out a single "beacon script" line in control.lua
    - Added support for Krastario 2 - the singularity beacon no longer gets disabled by standard or singularity beacons so it more
      closely matches the original behavior (it's powerful but not too powerful since it still disables standard beacons)
    - Added support for Exotic Industries - supercooled beacons don't disable each other but have strict exclusion areas so
      other beacons can't synergize with them; beacon overloading still works for beacons within 6 tiles of machines
    - Added support for Nullius - small and large beacons don't disable each other
    - Added support for SeaBlock - beacon 1 & 2 don't disable standard beacons but they do disable each other
    - Adjusted recipe order for Industrial Revolution 3 (no other changes seem necessary)
  Graphics:
    - Adjusted node/conflux sprites slightly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2024.02.16
  Balancing:
    - Increased stack size of beacons from 10 to 20
    - Increased exclusion range of conflux beacon by 2
    - Increased distribution/exclusion range of node beacon by 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2024.02.14
  Features:
    - Added new "conflux" beacon - for enabling a more decentralized style of building which can be comparable to hub beacons
    - A warning icon is now shown for disabled beacons to help distinguish them from active beacons
    - Beacons are no longer checked every X seconds by default (this is now an opt-in feature within the settings)
    - Added descriptions for each option within the settings
  Balancing:
    - Some minor recipe adjustments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2024.02.10
  Features:
    - Flying text now appears above beacons when they get disabled/enabled
  Balancing:
    - Increased distribution and exclusion range of focused beacons by 1
    - Increased module count of hub beacons by 1 (8->9)
    - Some minor adjustments to beacon recipes
  Changes:
    - Some logic for beacons from other mods (for now, it just sets their exclusion range to be the same as their distribution range)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2024.02.10
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug introduced in the previous update which prevented hub beacons from affecting other beacons properly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2024.02.09
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted power requirements for node beacons
  Graphics:
    - Updated graphic for isolation beacon
    - Adjusted colors and module visualization slightly for focused & node beacons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2024.02.09
  Balancing:
    - Reduced module count of "node" beacon from 4 to 3 and also reduced its exclusion range to match its distribution range
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected edge cases involving hub beacons - overlapping areas now only disable beacons if both beacons are in the same hub area
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2024.02.07
  Features:
    - Added new "node" beacon with medium distribution area and slightly larger exclusion area - for bridging the size gap between 
      standard and hub beacons; reaches relatively far while still interacting with smaller beacons in the usual way
    - Added new "isolation" beacon with huge distribution/exclusion areas - for niches where it's desirable to keep the number of 
      beacons to an absolute minimum
    - Added startup settings to enable/disable each beacon
  Balancing:
    - Reduced module power of "hub" beacon from 6 to 4 (6->8 module slots, 1.0->0.5 efficiency)
    - Increased distribution/exclusion ranges of "hub" beacon by 2 each
    - All non-standard beacons now treat the distribution area of standard beacons as if it is an exclusion area too - this doesn't 
      actually change functionality since no other beacons had an exclusion range below 3, but it does open up design space for the 
      next change to "focused" beacons:
    - Reduced exclusion range of "focused" beacon from 3 to 2
    - Adjusted recipe amounts slightly for "focused" beacons
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected behavior in some cases dealing with scripts from other mods
  Changes:
    - Refactored internal names
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2024.02.04
  Features:
    - Adjusted distribution/exclusion area visualizations to be uniform between different beacons
  Balancing:
    - Renamed new beacons from "small beacon" and "big beacon" to "focused beacon" and "hub beacon" respectively
    - Increased efficiency of big (hub) beacons from 0.75 to 1.0 and reduced module slots from 8 to 6 (same overall module power)
    - Increased max health of big (hub) beacons from 400 to 500
    - Moved new beacons to the original vanilla technology (custom technology removed)
    - Adjusted recipes of new beacons to use same types of ingredients as standard beacons
  Changes:
    - Renamed internal recipe IDs to match vanilla standard
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2024.01.30
  Graphics:
    - Updated placeholder graphics
  Changes:
    - Recipes for new beacons are now adjacent to the standard beacon recipe instead of below it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2024.01.29
