[mod-name]
alternative-beacons=Alternative Beacons

[mod-description]
alternative-beacons=Overhauls the beacon system to use exclusion areas in addition to distribution areas; adds new beacons with different niches while preserving the original game's balance. Integrates beacons from other mods into a single system. Beacons can be enabled or disabled individually in the settings.

[mod-setting-name]
ab-enable-exclusion-areas=DEV: Enable exclusion areas
ab-balance-other-beacons=Balance other beacons

[mod-setting-description]
ab-enable-exclusion-areas=Makes beacons use exclusion areas in addition to distribution areas. Disabling this will stop the mod from working as intended. Meant as a last resort for other mods to disable all scripting and implement their own.
ab-balance-other-beacons=Adjusts stats of beacons from the following mods to be fairer:\nBob's Modules\n5Dim's Modules\nAdvanced Modules (also adjusts modules)\nElgskred's Extension\nTarawind Beacons\nBetter Beacons
ab-override-vanilla-beacons=Overrides some balance changes made to vanilla beacons by other mods\nStats: 3x3, 2 modules, 0.5 effiency, 3 range
ab-enable-focused-beacons=Small beacons which are excellent in tight spaces\nStats: 2x2, 3 modules, 0.75 effiency, 2+1 range
ab-enable-node-beacons=Medium beacons which can fill multiple roles\nStats: 3x3, 3 modules, 0.5 effiency, 8 range
ab-enable-conflux-beacons=Large beacons which support decentralized building\nStats: 4x4, 6 modules, 0.5 effiency, 9+3 range
ab-enable-hub-beacons=Huge beacons which support centralized building\nStats: 4x4, 9 modules, 0.5 effiency, 14+20 range
ab-enable-isolation-beacons=Gigantic beacons which don't interact with other beacons\nStats: 5x5, 10 modules, 0.5 effiency, 30+38 range
ab-update-recipes=Updates recipes for new beacons to match the ingredient types used in standard beacons or equivalent beacons from other mods
ab-show-extended-stats=Shows additional details in beacon descriptions
ab-organize-groups=Consolidates items groups involving beacons if other related groups aren't present.
ab-update-rate=Controls whether the game updates all beacons periodically and how often to do so. May be useful for mods which cause beacons to behave incorrectly via bypassing the usual triggers for entity creation/destruction.\nLow values may cause performance issues.\nA value of 0 will disable this feature.

ei_beacon-overload=If disabled, supercooled beacons will be far more powerful than intended and smaller beacons such as standard and focused beacons will behave more normally.
