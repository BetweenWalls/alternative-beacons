alternative-beacons=Alternative Beacons

[mod-description]
alternative-beacons=Overhauls beacons to use exclusion areas in addition to distribution areas. Integrates beacons from multiple mods into a single system. Adds (optional) new beacons while preserving the functionality and usefulness of vanilla beacons.

ab-balance-other-beacons=Adjusts stats of beacons from the following mods to be fairer:\nBob's Modules\n5Dim's Modules\nAdvanced Modules\nMini Machines\nMicro Machines\nElgskred's Extension\nTarawind Beacons\nBetter Beacons\nStarry Sakura\nFast Furnaces
ab-override-vanilla-beacons=Overrides some balance changes made to vanilla beacons by other mods; creates a replacement instead if vanilla beacons have scripted behavior or cannot be cleanly overridden\nStats: 3x3, 2 modules, 0.5 effiency, 3 range
ab-enable-focused-beacons=Small beacons which are excellent in tight spaces\nStats: 2x2, 3 modules, 0.75 effiency, 2+1 range
ab-enable-node-beacons=Medium beacons which can fill multiple roles\nStats: 3x3, 3 modules, 0.5 effiency, 8 range
ab-enable-conflux-beacons=Large beacons which support decentralized building\nStats: 4x4, 6 modules, 0.5 effiency, 9+3 range
ab-enable-hub-beacons=Huge beacons which support centralized building\nStats: 4x4, 9 modules, 0.5 effiency, 14+20 range
ab-enable-isolation-beacons=Giant beacons which don't interact with other beacons\nStats: 5x5, 10 modules, 0.5 effiency, 30+8 strict range
ab-enable-se-beacons=Beacons which emulate those from Space Exploration; they have the same stats and machines cannot be affected by more than one simultaneously\nCreates new technologies for the beacons
ab-enable-k2-beacons=Beacons from Krastorio 2
ab-additional-technologies=Creates a new technology; splits new beacons across multiple technologies
ab-update-recipes=Updates recipes for new beacons to match the ingredient types used in standard beacons or equivalent beacons from other mods
ab-show-extended-stats=Shows additional details in beacon descriptions
ab-update-rate=Controls whether the game updates all beacons periodically and how often to do so. May be useful for mods which cause beacons to behave incorrectly via bypassing the usual triggers for entity creation/destruction.\nLow values may cause performance issues.\nA value of 0 will disable this feature.
ab-persistent-alerts=Alerts for disabled beacons persist until the issue is resolved.\nHas a minor performance impact.

ab-disable-exclusion-areas=Disables exclusion areas. This will stop the mod from working as intended. Meant as a last resort for other mods to disable all scripting and implement their own.
ei_beacon-overload=If disabled, supercooled beacons will be far more powerful than intended and smaller beacons such as standard and focused beacons will behave more normally.

title_alternative-beacons=Beacon Exclusion Areas
page_alternative-beacons_text_1=All beacons now have exclusion areas in addition to their distribution areas. These new areas affect other beacons instead of crafting machines.
page_alternative-beacons_text_2=By default, other beacons within the exclusion area will be disabled. Some beacons have a strict exclusion area and will disable other beacons whose distribution areas overlap it instead.\n\nBy default, new beacons from other mods will use an exclusion area which is equal to their distribution area.\n\nAdditionally, some beacons will ignore specific other beacons within their exclusion areas and not disable them.\n\nEach beacon's description covers exactly what it does.
