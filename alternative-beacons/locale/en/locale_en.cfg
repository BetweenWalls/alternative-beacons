[mod-setting-description]
ab-override-vanilla-beacons=Overrides changes to vanilla beacons made by other mods\nStats: 3x3, 2 modules, 0.5 effiency, 3 range
ab-enable-focused-beacons=Small beacons which are excellent in tight spaces\nStats: 2x2, 3 modules, 0.75 effiency, 2+1 range
ab-enable-node-beacons=Medium beacons which can fill multiple roles\nStats: 3x3, 3 modules, 0.5 effiency, 8 range
ab-enable-conflux-beacons=Large beacons which support decentralized building\nStats: 4x4, 6 modules, 0.5 effiency, 9+3 range
ab-enable-hub-beacons=Huge beacons which support centralized building\nStats: 4x4, 9 modules, 0.5 effiency, 14+20 range
ab-enable-isolation-beacons=Gigantic beacons which don't interact with other beacons\nStats: 5x5, 10 modules, 0.5 effiency, 30+38 range
ab-update-recipes=Updates recipes to match the ingredient types used in standard or other introductory beacons
ab-update-rate=Controls whether the game updates all beacons periodically and how often to do so. May be useful for mods which cause beacons to behave incorrectly via bypassing the usual triggers for entity creation/destruction.\nLow values may cause performance issues.\nUse any negative value to disable periodic updating.

ei_beacon-overload=If disabled, supercooled beacons will be far more powerful than intended and smaller beacons such as standard and focused beacons will be more useful.
