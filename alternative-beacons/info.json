	"description": "New beacons designed to accompany the vanilla beacons and offer additional building options while preserving the original level of balance.\n\nThis mod is a work-in-progress. The beacons are functional, but they use placeholder graphics and the visualizations are not polished. Balance may also be adjusted as more playtesting is done."
