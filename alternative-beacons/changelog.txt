Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2024.02.10
  Changes:
    - Increased distribution and exclusion range of focused beacons by 1
    - Increased module count of hub beacons by 1
    - Flying text now appears above beacons when they get disabled/enabled
    - Some minor adjustments to beacon recipes
    - Some logic for simple beacons from other mods (for now, it justs sets their exclusion range to be the same as their distribution range)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2024.02.10
  Changes:
    - Fixed a bug introduced in the previous update which prevented hub beacons from affecting other beacons properly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2024.02.09
  Changes:
    - Updated graphic for isolation beacon
    - Adjusted colors slightly for focused & node beacons
    - Adjusted power requirements and module visualization for node beacons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2024.02.09
  Changes:
    - Reduced module count of "node" beacon from 4 to 3 and also reduced its exclusion range to match its distribution range
    - Corrected edge cases involving hub beacons - overlapping areas now only disable beacons if both beacons are in the same hub area
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2024.02.07
  Changes:
    - Added new "node" beacon with medium distribution area and slightly larger exclusion area - for bridging the size gap between standard and hub beacons; reaches relatively far while still interacting with smaller beacons in the usual way
    - Added new "isolation" beacon with huge distribution/exclusion areas - for niches where it's desirable to keep the number of beacons to an absolute minimum
    - Added startup settings to enable/disable each beacon
    - Reduced module power of "hub" beacon from 6 to 4 (6->8 module slots, 1.0->0.5 efficiency)
    - Increased distribution/exclusion ranges of "hub" beacon by 2 each
    - All non-standard beacons now treat the distribution area of standard beacons as if it is an exclusion area too - this doesn't actually change functionality since no other beacons had an exclusion range below 3, but it does open up design space for the next change to "focused" beacons:
    - Reduced exclusion range of "focused" beacon from 3 to 2
    - Adjusted recipe amounts slightly for "focused" beacons
    - Corrected behavior in some cases dealing with scripts from other mods
    - Refactored internal names
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2024.02.04
  Changes:
    - Renamed new beacons from "small beacon" and "big beacon" to "focused beacon" and "hub beacon" respectively
    - Increased efficiency of big (hub) beacons from 0.75 to 1.0 and reduced module slots from 8 to 6 (same overall module power)
    - Increased max health of big (hub) beacons from 400 to 500
    - Moved new beacons to the original vanilla technology (custom technology removed)
    - Adjusted recipes of new beacons to use same types of ingredients as standard beacons
    - Renamed internal recipe IDs to match vanilla standard
    - Adjusted distribution/exclusion area visualizations to be uniform between different beacons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2024.01.30
  Changes:
    - Updated placeholder graphics
    - Recipes for new beacons are now adjacent to the standard beacon recipe instead of below it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
